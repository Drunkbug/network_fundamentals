======================Milestone=====================
httpserver:
    Use socket to establish http server.
    Parsing and handler user http request.
    Cache request data from origin server, or get data from local if already cached.
    Send requested http answer and data back to client.

dnsserver:
    Use socket to establish dns server.
    Receive client's dns request and parse each session.
    Pack each fields and session and send back formalized response with IP address.


=====================PROJECT 5=====================
Chanllenges:
We spent a lot of time on understanding each fields in each DNS session,
understanding how to formalize each fields and reply to client correctly.
Also, our dns header section shows Addition Section when we do dig on 
ccis server, while it shows Answer Section on our own servers.
    
Design dicision:
In httpserver. We have a list of URLData in out cache. A URLData has three fields:
URLList: a URLList is a list of url.
Data: the data is the wget data.
HitCount: the hitcount is the access count of the data.


Every time we receive a request, we check whether the url is in
the cache data. If the url is in the cache, we return the corresponding
data from the cache. If it is not in the cache, we fetch the data from
the original server. When we receive the data from the server, we check
whether the data is in the cache. If the data is in the cache we add
the new url to the list. If it is not, we create new URLData item.

When the cache file is larger than 10MB, we remove the (file size - 10MB
- 512KB) from the cache file. If the URLList's length is larger than
50,000, we will remove the last 25,000 URLData from the list.

In DNS server. We use Active Measurement and Geo Location to select the best replica,
when the server starts, it gets locations of all EC2 hosts. 
When it receives request from client, it first calculate distance between client and
all EC2 hosts, then select the top 3 clostest server. Then it sends HTTP request
to HTTP server and let it calculate latency between client and the ec2 host. 
Once DNS server get the latency of the three ec2 hosts, it select the one with lowest
latency.

Effectiveness:
We use [time wget] to test the download time. With the data in the cache,
we can reduce the download time from 0.7s to 0.1s.
We use Active Measurement and Geo Location to select best replica

Future Improvements:
1. We can use a special dictionary to implement the cache data. Since
List data structure is not time efficient, it will take a long time to
go through every item in the list

2. We can add Passive Measurement in DNS server

3. We can find some better way to speed up dns respond time
