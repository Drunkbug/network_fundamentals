Project 3
-----------Experiment 1-------------
In this experiment we need to analysis the performance of Tahoe, Reno, NewReno and Vegas under
different load.
The topology contains six nodes(N1 - N6).  Bandwidth between each node 
is set to 10 Mbps. A tcp stream is attached to N1 to a sink agent N4. CBR source is attached 
to N2 to a sink N3.

*Methodology*
We will start the CBR at a rate of 1Mbps and end with 10Mbps with increment of 0.5MB, 
Then start TCP stream and record the data between TCP starts and TCP stream becomes 
steady, record the throughput, latency and packet drop rate(y axis)
compare to CBR flow rate(x axis). To avoid noise, we will test each 
CBR rate multiple times and get the average, we will also calculate
the standard deviation based on repeat tests.

-----------Experiment 2-------------
In experiment 2 we need to compare the fairness between different TCP variants.
The topology is based on experiment 1, in addition we need to add another TCP 
variant on N5 to a sink N6.

*Methodology*
The methodology is similiar to experiment 1,
We will start the CBR at a rate of 1Mbps and end with 10Mbps with increment of 0.5MB, 
do each experiment multiple times, calculate average and standard deviation,
then record the throughput, latency and packet drop rate of N1 and N5, and compare 
these different pairs of TCP variants. 


-----------Experiment 3-------------
In experiment 3 we need to compare the performance of Reno and SACK by using two different 
algorithm: DropTail and Random Early Drop.
The topology is same from experiment 1 and having TCP flow from N1 to N4 and CBR flow from 
N5 to N6.

*Methodology*
The CBR flow rate is not relevant during experiment 3, thus we are going to set it to a
constant rate(e.g. 5Mbps). We will use throughput, latency and packet 
drop rate vs. time(s) graphics and compare Reno(DropTail), Reno(RED), SACK(DropTail), 
SACK(RED), CBR(DropTail), CBR(RED) in this experiment.
